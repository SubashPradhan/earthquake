				<strong>Rebuilding Nepal:</strong>
				<br>

				A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on 25 April 2015, followed just 18 days later by a second large earthquake. Almost 9,000 people lost their lives, over 600,000 homes were destroyed, and key infrastructure such as schools, health facilities, temples and roads was severely damaged.Thanks to public donations and the New Zealand Aid Programme, we were able to respond quickly to provide emergency aid including materials for shelter and to set up temporary learning classrooms for affected communities in the Everest region.The focus of the Himalayan Trust is now on rebuild and recovery. Over the next two to three years, we will focus on building seismically-strengthened school facilities, and bringing skills and training to help local communities recover. In total, Himalayan Trust supporters are funding the rebuild and repair of over 180 classrooms, as well as hostels and toilet blocks, at 33 schools across the Everest region. All the buildings will meet the latest seismic building codes.
